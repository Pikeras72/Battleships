# Battleships
Easy game to have a nice time :)

Select a mode to start playing, once you have selected a mode you can choose how
to establish your boats, locate a place, enter the row first (with a letter)
and then with the column (with a number), once you have choosed a position for your boat you can choose the direction
the boat will take (pointing to the north, the east, the south or the west).

The boats of the computer are generated randomly, you won't know where thei boats
are.

Each turn you have the opportunity to shoot a position on the computer's map, the
 same for the computer which will try to defeat you at all costs.

Good luck! I hope you like it :)
