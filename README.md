# Battleships

Easy game to have a nice time :)

Select a mode to start playing (1,2,3 or 4), once you have selected a mode you can choose how
to establish your boats. 

Firstly, locate a position to place your boat, then, enter the row (with a letter)
and then the column (with a number), once you have choosed a position for your boat 
you can choose the direction the boat will face (pointing to the north, the east, 
the south or the west).

After placing your boats, the boats of the computer will be generated randomly, you 
won't know where the enemy boats are, obviously ;)

Each turn you have the opportunity to shoot a position (entering a row and a column) 
on the computer's map, the same case for the computer which will try to defeat you 
at all costs.

You must take into account that if you hit an enemy boat you will have the opportunity to 
shoot again. Don't forget that it is exactly the same for the computer!

Good luck! I hope you like it :)

Don't forget to suggest changes, this project is not finished yet.
